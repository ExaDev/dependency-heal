// Recommended config, not the plugin itself: this both enables the prettier/prettier rule (reports formatting differences as lint errors, reading prettier.config.ts the same way `prettier --check` does) and applies eslint-config-prettier, which turns off every ESLint stylistic rule that could otherwise disagree with Prettier. It carries no `files:` restriction of its own, so it applies to everything ESLint actually lints below — YAML is untouched here (no ESLint language plugin for it), so `npm run format:check` remains the one authoritative formatting check that also covers the workflow YAML files.
